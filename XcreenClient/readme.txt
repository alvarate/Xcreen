1. The components "OleAuto" and "Ole2" are needed for compiling this program. 
   If the compiler complains that these components could not be found, you need 
   to do according to the following directions:
   A. Find the installation path of your Delphi7. Let it is "D:\Program Files\Borland\Delphi7"
   B. Go to the folder "D:\Program Files\Borland\Delphi7\Lib\Delphi2", and you can find the 
      three files: OleAuto.dcu¡¢Ole2.dcu¡¢OleCtl.dcu. Copy all these files to 
      "D:\Program Files\Borland\Delphi7\Lib"

2. ICall.dll, MouseHook.dll, KeyboardHook.dll and GetWordNT.dll must be in the same folder with the main executable file.

3. DLL calling mode is depressed. Please use the ActiveX calling samples.
